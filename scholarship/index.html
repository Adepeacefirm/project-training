      <h1>Study at SQI at little or NO cost!</h1>
      <p>
        In 2011 SQI College of ICT, then known as SQI ICT Academy, launched a
        yearly scholarship program to open a wider window of opportunity to
        every promising individual who is passionate about acquiring an ICT
        skill, and today we have trained and certified over 10,000+ youths who
        currently hold important and viable positions in various organizations
        nationwide. <br /><br />
        The scholarship program is open to every individual between the ages of
        13 to 28. This annual scholarship program gives everyone (i.e O-level,
        A-Level, School Leavers, Undergraduates, Employed Graduates, Unemployed
        Graduates etc.) an opportunity to take any of our ICT courses at little
        or no cost. <br /><br />
        The scholarship program has over the years taken many unique approaches
        to identify and evaluate suitable candidates for the award of either
        full or partial scholarship.
